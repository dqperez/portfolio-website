          Hello again! I graduated from the University of the Philippines Manila with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science.
          <br/><br/>
          Other than coding, I spend most of my free time playing competitive or cozy games ðŸ¤“. I've also been trying to read more so feel free to reach out to me with any book recommendations!
